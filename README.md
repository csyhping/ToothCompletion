# This is a project about tooth completion. Currently under development.  
√ Load the mesh  
√ Visualize the mesh  
√ Identify the boundary  
√ Select two vertex and create a straight line between them (mouse interaction)  
√ Create new vertices on the straight line base on the average edge length of the mesh (keyboard interaction)  
√ Construct the hole area  
√ Fit a plane for hole vertices
√ Project the hole vertices to the plane 
? Rotate the plane to a (x, y) plane 
? 2D Delauney(triangulation & refinement)  
? Project back to 3D  
? Fairing  
? Detect intersection  
? Adjust the intersection  
? Get the final result  
? Use script to process automatically with more data
